<h4>DESIGN HISTORY</h4>
<p> As of 1986, even among scholars publishing in the field, the exact boundaries of vernacular have not been clear. This issue of definition, apparently so simple, has proven to be one of the most serious problems for advocates of vernacular architecture and landscapes research. A straightforward, convincing, authoritative definition has not yet been offered. Vernacular architecture is a phenomenon that many understand intuitively but that few are able to define. The literature on the subject is thus filled with what might be called non-definitions.

<h2>Types of Modern Design</h2>
<p><b>Vernacular architecture</b> is non-high style building, it is those structures not designed by professionals; it is not monumental; it is un-sophisticated; it is mere building; it is, according to the distinguished historian Nikolaus Pevsner, not architecture. Those who take a more positive approach rely on adjectives like ordinary, everyday, and commonplace. While these terms are not as pejorative as other descriptive phrases that are sometimes applied to the vernacular, neither are they very precise. For example, the skyscrapers of Manhattan are works of high style architecture, but they are also commonplace in Manhattan. Are they not logically New York City vernacular buildings.<p/>
Victorian architecture is a series of architectural revival styles in the mid-to-late 19th century. Victorian refers to the reign of Queen Victoria, called the Victorian era, during which period the styles known as Victorian were used in construction.Vernacular architecture tends to be overlooked in traditional histories of design. It is not a stylistic description, much less one specific style, so it cannot be summarized in terms of easy-to-understand patterns, characteristics, materials, or elements. Because of the usage of traditional building methods and local builders, vernacular buildings are considered cultural expressionsaboriginal, indigenous, ancestral, rural, ethnic, or regionalas much as architectural artifacts.The term Modern architecture describes architecture designed and built within the social, artistic, and cultural attitude known as Modernism. It put an emphasis on experimentation, the rejection of predetermined rules, and freedom of expression in art, literature, architecture, and music.
<p><b>Gangi House</b> the interior space is arranged with the water and other facilities between the two frontage rooms on the west side, and the eaves, which protrude 2,275mm to the east, are placed parallel to the exterior earthen floor, creating an interior earthen floor connecting the road and farmland. This two-layered vaulted earthen floor space connects each space to the outside, creating a comfortable living space that allows light, wind, and sight lines to pass through from north to south while encompassing a variety of activities. This space is both an entrance and a living room. It is also a place for children to run around, for meetings, for work, and for the creation of ideas.<br></p>

<p><b> Classical architecture</b> usually denotes architecture which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of Greek and Roman architecture of classical antiquity, or sometimes even more specifically, from the works of the Roman architect Vitruvius. Gothic architecture is an architectural style that was prevalent in Europe from the late 12th to the 16th century, during the High and Late Middle Ages, surviving into the 17th and 18th centuries in some areas. It evolved from Romanesque architecture and was succeeded by Renaissance architecture.<p/>
